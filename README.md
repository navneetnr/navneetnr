        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Biodegradable materials are substances that can be broken down into simpler compounds by natural biological processes, such as bacteria or fungi, over time. These materials decompose into non-toxic elements, water, and carbon dioxide, leaving little to no harmful residue in the environment. This decomposition process is crucial for reducing pollution and waste accumulation, particularly in landfills and oceans. Biodegradable materials encompass a wide range of substances, including organic matter like food waste, as well as specially designed synthetic polymers that break down more readily than traditional plastics. However, it's important to note that not all biodegradable materials degrade at the same rate or under the same conditions, so careful consideration of the specific environment and disposal methods is necessary for effective waste management.</p>
